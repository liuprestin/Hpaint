WEB Paint clone project

I think this is a good demonstration of working with a new API; and 
why examples are great to have (otherwise - one would need to experiment and reverse engineer in order to reveal the actual functionality).

**notes to self:**
- be aware of what elements are being targeted in js. You can also target children of said element, general tag types (mulitple elements at the same time)
- notice that there is 'change' - so more reactionary

- note: javascript color picker was added for consistantcy between OS systems.

when reading a doc - what exactly are you seeking todo? (normally one would pull up the documentation with this in mind)
in your app (or project) what variables/elements/objects are you keeping track of? 
how are they being tracked? how are they being stored? what properties and behaviours does the storage have? 

whats the relevent information?
